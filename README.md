# Summary 
These are the source files for the PCB assembly frame.

To compile, you need both [BOSL](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL) and [NopSCADlib](https://github.com/nophead/NopSCADlib/blob/master/readme.md)
installed in your OpenSCAD library folder.

# Instructions
Please have a look at the [Thingiverse Project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4232314) for pictures,
instructions and details.

# Bug Reports
I do not accept bug reports because this is a project which I do not plan to maintain. However, feel
free to create a fork and create pull requests.

I will *not* check the pull requests for functionality or plausability. I already built my PCB assembly frame.
